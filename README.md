# Final Capstone
â€‹ 
I saved my work on my final capstone to a thumb drive and have uploaded it to this github repo to discuss with prospective employers. The initial project was on a shared gitlab repo for me and my teammates. I worked with a great team to deliver this project in less than two weeks and I was tasked with writing SQL inserts, models, controllers, Daos, and much more. I tested most of the endpoints for the project and my main focus on the frontend was the review functionality, like functionality, average-rating functionality, and user-page. 

One of my team members, Brennan Sheehan has added it to AWS so it's alive on the web! I'm currently adding updates for mobile and other functionalities from a forked repo of his. Below is the link to the active site, database and fronted hosted on AWS (We are refactoring our project structure which has led to bugs in the like functionality which we're currently working on as well)
